## Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a C++ programmer trying to find justice for void*. I am probably working on my honours project right now (aka playing Risk of Rain 2 while thinking about it).

Here you can find my blogs and guides, as well as current ways of contacting me. In the future you will also be able to find all my projects here.
