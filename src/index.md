## Welcome to my personal website!

I'm a C++ programmer trying to find justice for void*. I have recently completed my Honours project and successfully graduated from Abertay University in game programming.

Here you can find my blogs and guides, as well as current ways of contacting me. In the future you will also be able to find all my projects here.
