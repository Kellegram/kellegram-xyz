# A little bit about me

## Who am I?

I'm a Polish game development graduate doing... not that.

## My current goals

My main goal right now is to build up a portfolio and improve my current programming skills. I am currently in the planning process for an evolution style game using machine learning via genetic algorithms. It will be a Free and Open Source project.

I am also improving my knowledge of networking and plan to study cybersecurity for my future employment.

## The nearest future

I plan to complete as many courses related to my interests as possible. I believe we never stop evolving and we never stop learning and I try to expand my knowledge whenever I can. I want to expand my projects to include more than just the evolution game, as well as learn the deeper secrets of Linux.
